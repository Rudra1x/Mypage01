        <div id="container-child2"> <h1>About Us :</h1>
            <p>At Sachin Kumar & Associates, we believe that architecture is not just about building structures; it is
                an art that shapes the way we live, work, and interact with the world around us. Established with a
                vision to blend the ancient wisdom of traditional Vaastu with the innovative principles of Pyramid
                Vaastu, we are a leading architecture firm committed to creating spaces that inspire and nurture
                harmony.</p>
            <div class="philo">
                <h2>Our Philosophy </h2>
                <p>We understand the significance of creating spaces that align with the natural forces and energies
                    that govern our universe. Our approach is rooted in the time-tested principles of Vaastu Shastra,
                    which aims to establish a harmonious balance between the occupants and their environment. By
                    combining this knowledge with the transformative power of Pyramid Vaastu, we offer a unique and
                    effective approach to design and build architecture.</p></div>
